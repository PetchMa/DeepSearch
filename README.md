# DeepSearch
This is a python implementation of DeepSeti - an algorithm designed to detect anomalies for Radio telescope data open sourced by Breakthrough Listen. This module facilitates the custom architecture and training loops required for the DeepSeti algorithm to preform a multichannel search for anomalies. Main objective is to develop software thats that increase the computational sensitivity and speed to search for unpredictable anomalies.
